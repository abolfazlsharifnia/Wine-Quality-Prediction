# Wine-Quality-Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties. The model uses a dataset of red and white wines with various properties such as acidity, alcohol content, and pH, along with a quality rating from 0 to 10.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality dataset, which is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains various properties of red and white wines, along with a quality rating from 0 to 10.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required libraries:


### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `wine_quality_prediction.ipynb`.
2. Run the cells to train the model and make predictions.

## Model

The model used in this project is a Random Forest regressor, which is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## Results

The model achieved an R-squared value of X.XX on the testing data, indicating a good fit to the data.
